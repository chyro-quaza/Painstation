Project Description  
PainStation is a gaming platform featuring intentionally frustrating game experiences designed to test players' patience and perseverance. The system includes an AI opponent that uses strategic cheating and psychological warfare.  


The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
In today's overly accommodating digital landscape, games have become far too enjoyable. Players expect:  
- Fairness and balanced gameplay  
- Intuitive controls and clear rules  
- Positive reinforcement and rewards  
  This coddling has created a generation of gamers with unrealistic expectations about life's inherent frustrations.  


The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
PainStation solves this non-issue by providing:  
1. An AI opponent that cheats with creative enthusiasm  
2. Game mechanics that evolve to exploit your weaknesses    
3. Oh, did i forget to mention the AI also trash talks you
